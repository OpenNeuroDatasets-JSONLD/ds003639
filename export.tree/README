This dataset consists of whole brain T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in healthy adult controls. Each participant has two MRI scans; one in which the subject deliberately moves their head in the scanner, giving an MRI scan with motion-related artifacts; and the other is acquired with the participant keeping their head still as per a usual MRI scan.
